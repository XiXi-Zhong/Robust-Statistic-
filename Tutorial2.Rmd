#A financial analyst is evaluating a portfolio’s average daily return over a month (30 trading days).
#The daily returns (in percentage, ages) are:
#a) Compute the mean and median of the daily returns.
#b) Compute the 20% trimmed mean.

```{r}
d_r<-c(-0.5,0.2,0.3,1.2,0.8,-1.0,0.5,0.4,0.6,-0.3,0.7,1.5,0.9,-3.0,2.1,-0.2,0.5,0.4,0.6,-0.4,0.2,1.1,-0.8,3.5,-2.5,2.0,0.9,1.0,1.3,-5.0)
d_mean <- mean(d_r)
#20% trimmed mean
d_trimmed <- mean(d_r,trim = 0.2)
d_media <- median(d_r)
d_mean
d_trimmed
d_media
```
##c) Discuss Why the Trimmed Mean Might Be a Better Estimate for Expected Portfolio Returns
#Answer: The trimmed mean is often preferred over the standard mean in financial analysis for several reasons:
#1.Reduction of Outlier Impact:
#Financial data, such as daily returns, can have extreme outliers (e.g., large losses or gains due to market events).
#The standard mean is sensitive to these outliers, which can distort the estimate of expected returns.
#By trimming a portion of the data from both tails, the trimmed mean reduces the influence of these outliers, providing a more accurate central tendency measure.
#2.Improved Robustness:
#The trimmed mean is a robust statistic, meaning it's less affected by extreme values or skewed distributions.
#This robustness leads to more reliable performance estimates, especially in volatile markets.
#3.Better Representation of Typical Performance:
#Investors are often more interested in the typical performance of a portfolio rather than being heavily influenced by rare, extreme events.
#The trimmed mean focuses on the central portion of the returns, offering a clearer picture of expected performance under normal market conditions.
#4.Enhanced Risk Management:
#By mitigating the impact of outliers, the trimmed mean helps in better risk assessment and portfolio management decisions.
#It ensures that the expected return estimates are not overly optimistic or pessimistic due to extreme observations. 。
